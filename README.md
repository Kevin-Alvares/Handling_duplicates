# Handling Duplicates in SQL

You're probably here after reading my article on medium or from my LinkedIn. Either way let me help you naviagte this repository.

1. Start off with the create_table.sql file
2. Once you've created both tables, head over to the pirate_king folder. This has 3 sql files with both the appraoches mentioned in the article and the bonus file.
3. You can follow the article I wrote on medium to better understand the techniques.
